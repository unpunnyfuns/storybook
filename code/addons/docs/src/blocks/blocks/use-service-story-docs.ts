/**
 * Subscribes docs blocks to one story in the preview's local `core/story-docs` runtime.
 *
 * Derives the component id from the story id and uses the query's selector subscription so the
 * callback only fires when the selected story slice changes — not when a sibling story in the same
 * CSF file updates. Returns the full {@link QueryState} — the selected `data` plus the load lifecycle
 * (`isInitialLoading`, `isError`, etc.) — so blocks can react to loading and error states.
 *
 * Requires a concrete story id and a registered `core/story-docs` service. Callers whose service may
 * be absent must guard at a parent and conditionally render a child that calls this hook. The React
 * 16/17-safe subscription mechanics live in {@link useQuerySubscription}.
