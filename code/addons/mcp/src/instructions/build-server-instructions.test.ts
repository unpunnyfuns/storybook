			- Before creating or editing components or stories, call **get-storybook-story-instructions**; its output is the source of truth for imports, story patterns, and testing conventions.
			- After editing anything that changes how the UI looks — components, stories, styles, themes, tokens — call **get-changed-stories** to discover the affected stories.
			- End your final response with the review section from **display-review**'s result — never substitute preview URLs. **preview-stories** is only for mid-loop iteration or a requested direct link. If nothing visually changed, say so.
			- After a visually observable UI change, or when the user asks to see or browse stories/components, call **display-review** (again on each iteration) and follow its description and result. Visual work is not done until the review is published; any newly created story MUST be included.
			- Only use story IDs returned by tools — never derive them from file names or memory. **get-stories-by-component** maps any input to stories; its description covers the workflow. No matches means no stories exist yet — say so.

			## Validation Workflow

			- After editing anything that changes how the UI looks, run **run-story-tests** — never a package.json test script.
			- Never report completion while story tests are failing.

			## Documentation Workflow

			**CRITICAL: Never hallucinate component properties!** Undocumented props do not exist — never assume them from naming or other libraries; verify every prop via these tools, not source or types in node_modules.

			1. Call **list-all-documentation** once at task start for component and docs IDs.
			2. Call **get-documentation** with an \`id\` from that list for props and usage examples.

			Only reference IDs returned by these tools — never guess; scope multi-source requests with \`storybookId\`."
