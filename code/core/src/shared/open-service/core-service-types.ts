/**
 * The core services registered in each runtime.
 *
 * These lists are the single source of truth: the `*CoreServices` types below derive their keys
 * from each definition's `id` (so `getService` typing follows the list), and
 * `core-service-types.test.ts` checks the lists against the per-runtime registrar-file convention
 * (a `services/<name>/<runtime>.{ts,tsx}` file exists for each listed service, and vice versa) to
 * catch a service being added to one without the other. Note this guards the convention, not the
 * actual call: a service can have a registrar file yet still not be wired up by its caller.
 *
 * Each list only references definitions already loaded in that runtime, and the runtime entrypoints
 * import the derived *types* (`import type`), so these value imports add no runtime cost to the
 * manager/preview/server bundles — only the membership test pulls them in as values.
 *
 * Stateful services shared across realms appear in each matching list so their state can synchronize.
