/**
 * Unified service registry for the open-service multi-master architecture.
 *
 * One implementation backs every runtime — the dev server (Node), the manager (top window), and each
 * preview iframe. Registration builds a local `ServiceRuntime` and, when a channel is present, wires it
 * into the cross-peer sync protocol through the shared transport. The only thing that differs per
 * runtime is the `relay` role: the dev server and the manager are hubs (`relay: true`) that bridge
 * their other channel transports, while a preview is a leaf (`relay: false`) — a single transport has
 * nothing to forward. The handshake + patch-broadcast protocol lives in `service-transport.ts` and the
 * last-write-wins reconciliation in `service-sync.ts`; both transports drive them identically.
 *
 * The registry is anchored on a symbol-keyed `globalThis` slot so every module in one realm shares a
 * single registration map even if this file is reached through different import paths. Server (Node),
 * manager (top window), and preview (iframe) are already isolated realms, so one symbol is correct for
 * all three — they never share a map at runtime.
