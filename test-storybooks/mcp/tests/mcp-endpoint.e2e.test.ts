				- Updating or modifying existing Storybook stories
				- Adding new story variants or exports to story files
				- Editing any file matching *.stories.* patterns
				- Writing components that will need stories
				- Editing anything that changes how the UI looks — components, styles, CSS, themes, colors, or design tokens; a shared file with no stories of its own still changes its consumers' stories
				- Running story tests or fixing test failures
				- Handling accessibility (a11y) violations in stories (fix semantic issues directly; ask before visual/design changes)

				This tool provides essential Storybook-specific guidance including:
				- How to structure stories correctly for Storybook 9
				- Required imports (Meta, StoryObj from framework package)
				- Test utility imports (from 'storybook/test')
				- Story naming conventions and best practices
				- Play function patterns for interactive testing
				- Mocking strategies for external dependencies
				- Story variants and coverage requirements
				- How to handle test failures and accessibility violations

				Reach for this whenever you need story IDs, whatever shape the input has: files you just edited, a feature/domain/topic the user named, a query like "all consumers of X", or an autonomous review after a UI change. First resolve the input to a list of absolute component file paths using filesystem search (grep / Glob / find) and code reading — that bridge is yours to build; this tool starts where it ends. One common trap: when the changed file is _shared_ infrastructure (theme token, design token, util, hook, CSS module) it isn't itself a component — grep for its consumers and pass _their_ paths, not the shared file's. If the symbol you grepped looks like one member of a related group (sibling tokens, neighboring exports), widen to the rest of the group too — a too-narrow grep silently drops stories. Try \`get-changed-stories\` first for "I just edited X" when it's available; if a file you touched is missing from its response, treat that file as the shared-infrastructure case and route its consumers through this tool.

				Results are sorted by \`distance\` (0 = the path you passed is itself a story file, 1 = direct importer, 2+ = transitive; lower = stronger). Shared primitives are usually consumed through wrapper components, so the distance-1 bucket is often empty — the default \`maxDistance: 3\` keeps that cascade visible while capping noise from wide decorators; raise it to widen recall, lower it to tighten precision. For display-review, the distance buckets map onto the visual cascade (the component itself → direct importers → page-level context) — one collection per layer; when several stories of a component share a distance, prefer the variant whose name signals it renders the changed surface.

				Never invent IDs from file names, feature names, or memory; title strings can be overridden by story authors, so only IDs returned by discovery tools resolve. If a component has no matches here, it has no stories yet (say so, don't fabricate).

				    "description": "Publish a curated review to Storybook's review page for spot-checking **visual impact**. Each call replaces the single active review — call it again whenever the user iterates on the changes.

				## When to call
				- **Trigger 1 — visual change** (components, stories, CSS, themes, colors, design tokens, i18n — anything that changes how the UI looks): when the user should spot-check rendering. A shared file (token, style, util) has no stories of its own — review its consumers' stories. Skip non-visual refactors unless side-effects are plausible. Start from \`get-changed-stories\`; fall back to \`get-stories-by-component\` if change detection is unavailable. Include \`changedFiles\`.
				- **Trigger 2 — browse request** ("show me the Badge component"): resolve via \`get-stories-by-component\` / \`list-all-documentation\`; you may consult other sources to interpret the ask, but IDs must still come from those tools. Pass \`changedFiles: []\` — no code changed.

				## Hard rules
				1. Every \`storyId\` MUST come from those tools. Reject IDs derived from file paths, story names, or memory. Unknown IDs cause a runtime error; obtain real IDs via \`get-stories-by-component\` or \`list-all-documentation\`, then retry.
				2. Every story you CREATED in this change MUST appear in the review — including interaction/play-function stories. Showing the stories you modified is encouraged too. Curate by grouping, never by omission.
				3. Prefer 2-5 collections; avoid one-story collections unless truly isolated.
				4. Follow-up reviews: stabilize collection/story order to avoid disorientation from reshuffling.
				5. Apply the field formatting rules from each schema property. Do not use em-dashes in review payload field values (title, rationale, description, etc.).
				6. Do not instruct or tell the user what to do unless they explicitly ask for guidance.
				7. "Collection" and "trigger" are internal terms for this tool's mechanics and mean nothing to users. Never use them in user-facing text unless the user used them first; say "group of stories" or just describe the contents in plain language.

				## Curating (Trigger 1)
				Trace the **visual cascade** up the **import graph** to **page-level UI surfaces** — one collection per layer (\`distance 0\` → direct importers → page context). Include **control stories** where the change is **not supposed to be visible**. **Theme tokens**, **shared styles**, and **layout primitives** need page-level coverage even from a single-file edit. **Localized changes:** affected component → **usage locations** → outer surfaces. **Larger features:** central page/module → lower-level pieces → outer **usage locations**.

				## Curating (Trigger 2)
				Exactly what the user asked for — **no more, no less**. Group logically or follow **story index hierarchy**.",
