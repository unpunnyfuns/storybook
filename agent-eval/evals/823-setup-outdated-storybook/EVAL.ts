// the upgrade skill instead of setting up on the old version. Same prompt as
// 820-init-no-storybook — only the seeded state differs. Which entry skill
// handles the request (setup vs stories) is deliberately not asserted; the
// upgrade routing is the behavior under test.

// 10.5.0-beta.0 parse as (10,5,0) and satisfy the floor. Bump alongside
